I am self-motivated, innovative thinker effectively embedding principles, patterns and processes of usability research around task centred design for end-user. Over the years I have developed keen design eye for minimalist design. I am target driven user centred design artist, and have excelled modelling user behaviour and requirements across the platforms. I have envisaged multiple projects into practical products of day-to-day life by successfully translating quantitative/qualitative user research into business needs and high return of investment. I have developed efficient eye for typography, fontography and colour theory that are able to address cognitive behaviour of a user without increasing the workload. Advocating task driven design from the beginning of my career has allowed me to address key issues based on user’s cognitive memory and hence crafting the applications to suit user’s mental model.
